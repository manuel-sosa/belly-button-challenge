## **Module 14 Challenge: Belly Button Biodiversity dataset**
See app.js file for code review: [https://github.com/manuel-sosa/belly-button-challenge/blob/main/StarterCode/static/js/app.js]

The Module 14 Challenge tasks participants with creating an **interactive dashboard** to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. 

It involves implementing ***bar and bubble charts using D3.js*** to visualize data and deploying the application to GitHub Pages. The challenge requires coding skills in JavaScript, particularly in handling DOM manipulation and **data visualization**, as well as proficiency in deploying web applications.

This project is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate abilities in data-driven storytelling and web development.
